This project is about making a simple ai that responds to its environment.
The player is a cop and the ai agents are robbers.
Player moves in the most simplistic manner where they only change their axis in the world and can not interract with collisions, but player has a stamina system where they can only run for a limited amount of time than they have to rest a while to run again
Ai have simple decisions to make here while the player is not looking or they are not close ai wanders around, if the player is close they try to escape them and if they are not close however they are looking at the robber they try to hide from the player by running behind some obsticles.
The ai can also persue some a target however this does implamented but not included in current build I will update this later on
